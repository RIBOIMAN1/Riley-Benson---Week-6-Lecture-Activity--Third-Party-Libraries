    <h3 class="JustifyText GreenYellowFont magictime vanishIn">I had started off as a Windows user (at home) and a Chrome OS user (at school). Yes, I am aware that Chrome OS is technically a super tweaked fork of Gentoo Linux, but for the purposes of this, I'm not referring to Chrome OS as Linux. Anyways, I had a gaming laptop with Windows 11 on it (specifically, a custom version of Windows called Tiny11), and it was a decent experience, but after a while, I was starting to have random issues like the file explorer crashing after doing basic file exports, .dll files being missing, and a generally unpleasant experience was starting to come afloat. Around this time, I had received my very own Steam Deck, too, which is an Arch based operating system designed to look like a console and essentially give the user a Linux gaming PC with the convenience of a handheld console. The most I was doing at the time was trying out flatpak apps and appimages, nothing too crazy, but I slowly started to appreciate the tweakability and speed of the system I had. As a result, I went distro hopping on my gaming laptop (switching between Linux distros very frequently) until I found something that worked for me. This ended up being Linux Mint, which turned out to be a great distro!</h3> <!-- h3 element paragraph with justified alignment, green-yellow colored font, and the vanishIn command from the Magic Animations CSS library -->
    <h3 class="JustifyText PlumFont magictime twisterInDown">This was around the time when I started getting quite comfortable with Linux. I had been learning new things about the terminal every day, and how to leverage it to do many great things. Whether it be installing programs or editing config files, I did it in the command line! I eventually got a bunch of extra PC's as well, and I went completely into Linux, finding and fine-tuning the prefect distributions for my needs.</h3> <!-- h3 element paragraph with justified alignment, plum colored font, and the twisterInDown command from the Magic Animations CSS library -->
    <h3 class="JustifyText magictime boingInUp">Nowadays, I am running a variety of Linux distros. I did do a bunch of distro hopping on my gaming laptop, however I went back to Linux Mint, and specifically the MATE desktop environment, as it has the best Nvidia support (and I can't find out why). In terms of my other computers, I have my AMD Lenovo ThinkPad running Manjaro with the GNOME desktop environment. Manjaro is an arch-based distro that is very stable, and I use it every day, and as a matter of fact, I coded this website using Manjaro. GNOME extensions are AMAZING! Of course, my Steam Deck still runs SteamOS, but other than that, I have an Intel Mini desktop PC running Arch Linux with KDE Plasma (i use arch btw ðŸ˜‰). Linux is NOT for everybody, and I honestly don't recommend it to the vast majority of people, but if you are interested, I'd recommend Linux Mint to anyone getting in to the space. It is similar to Windows in terms of interface, and a lot of the OS is gui-based, so it is easier to use and quite stable. I'd recommend going for Manjaro or Arch if you want to go beyond Mint later, as they aren't super hard to install (Arch has tons of installation scripts out there), and things like the AUR make things quite a breeze if you know your way around Linux.</h3> <!-- h3 element paragraph with justified alignment and the boingInUp command from the Magic Animations CSS library -->
